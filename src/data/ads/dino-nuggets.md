This episode of Logan, from the Internet is brought to you by Dino Nuggets.

Are you a millennial parent desperately convincing yourself you made the right choice bringing children into the world? Do you hope that good intentions can somehow shield your kids from inheriting a dying planet ruled by billionaires?

Do you spend precious free time researching organic, locally-sourced foods? Do you believe that will separate you from the bad parents? Does your little one refuse the quinoa and the ranch dressing and the grilled chicken you fed them?

Do you scroll past images of genocide and feel terror, knowing you can't protect your kids from the world? Give up. Just feed your toddler the awful processed chicken shapes and move on. You must be the the worst parent alive.

But Dino Nuggets are not failure. They're a strategy.

Your great-grandmother fed her kids whatever kept them alive during the bad times; flour and water pancakes, potato peels, dandelion greens from the yard. She opened cans of Chef Boyardee without shame when the war ended, grateful that food could come from a shelf rather than a garden. She mixed Tang with tap water and called it breakfast, amazed that orange flavor could come from a packet. 

Because she understood that fed, loved children grow up to change the world. Those children built unions and fought fascists. Those kids ended segregation. They went to the moon.

Dino Nuggets are buying you time. Time to rest. Time to organize. Time to build resilience instead of anxiety. Your kids don't need a perfect parent â€“ they need one who's rested enough to actually see them, fight for them, believe in them.

Because every generation gets handed a nightmare. Your great-grandmother got economic collapse and Nazis. We have late-stage capitalism and ecological collapse. And also Nazis. But humans are relentlessly, stupidly hopeful. We gotta keep going. And so we eat, rest, and wake up again tomorrow.

Dino Nuggets: Your great-grandmother would approve.
