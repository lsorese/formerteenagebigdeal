The internet of today is a corporate and sanitized wasteland compared to the wild west days of Geocities, IRC, MySpace, Habbo Hotel, Newgrounds, Friendster, LiveJournal, AIM, ICQ, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Chat, DeviantArt, Albino Blacksheep, eBaum's World, Something Awful, Neopets, MapQuest, Kazaa, LimeWire, and Xanga where every web page was a unique snowflake of blinking text and MIDI files that played automatically, where teenagers learned HTML by copying and pasting shiny cursor codes and where you could spend hours in IRC channels talking to strangers about obscure anime without an algorithm trying to sell you something, where MySpace let you customize your profile with CSS until it looked like a unicorn had exploded on your screen and nobody cared because it was YOURS, where Habbo Hotel's pixelated furniture trading economy was more authentic than today's NFT markets, where Newgrounds was a breeding ground for flash animations that would make Rick and Morty look like corporate garbage tested in focus groups, where LiveJournal gave you real privacy settings and real communities instead of being psychologically manipulated by feeds designed to maximize engagement and make you angry and addicted, where AIM away messages were poetry and ICQ's "uh oh" sound was the summit of digital communication, where finding a website meant following webrings and bookmarks instead of Google's SEO-manipulated results, where Yahoo! chat rooms were chaotic but human, where DeviantArt was really about art and not AI-generated crap, where Albino Blacksheep and eBaum's World curated weird content instead of TikTok's algorithmic dopamine dispenser, where Something Awful forums had real moderation and community standards, where Neopets taught kids about virtual economics without predatory microtransactions, where MapQuest printed directions made road trips an adventure instead of GPS turning us into navigation zombies, where Kazaa and LimeWire were digital treasure hunts that connected you to other people's music libraries instead of Spotify's sanitized catalog, and where Xanga blogs were raw and unfiltered teenage angst instead of Instagram's performative highlights, because back then the internet was made by weirdos for weirdos instead of being made by corporations for consumers, it was decentralized and unpredictable and genuinely social instead of being five giant websites filled with screenshots of text from the other four, it rewarded creativity and technical skills instead of engagement metrics and advertising revenue, it fostered real communities around shared interests instead of algorithmic echo chambers designed to keep you scrolling, and most importantly it felt like a place you could really inhabit and make your own instead of just another platform designed to extract your data and attention while giving you nothing meaningful in return.
