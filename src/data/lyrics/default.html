<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>This is an album called <strong>Former Teenage Big Deal</strong> by <em>Logan, from the Internet!</em>. It was written and released in 2025. It was created mostly using digital instruments and found sounds.</p>
<p>It features screaming, commentary on the cruelty of a neighbor in a nearby 55-and-older neighborhood, post-doomer hand-wringing, a cover of an AI girly pop song, a cover a Y2K girly pop song, a value judgement on the benefits of polyamory, and a reminder of that one time that Joey Chestnut <span class="censor"></span> choked that dude out.</p>

<p><strong>Unfriendly Reminder</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/spotifys-daniel-ek-leads-investment-in-defense-startup-helsing.html" target="_blank">Spotify's CEO has made billion dollar investments that turn your subscription money into dead brown children and forever wars.</a> And their audio quality is terrible. This album is still available on their service because I am a hypocrite who would like people to listen to their music. But I don't recommend it.</p>
