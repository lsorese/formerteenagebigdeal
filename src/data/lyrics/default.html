<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>This is an album called <strong>Former Teenage Big Deal</strong> by <em>Logan, from the Internet!</em>. It was created and released in 2025. It is an odd album, created with digital instruments, in the style of the music that was common in 2006 -- namely guitars, screaming, and double-bass pedals.</p>
<p>It features screaming, dead memes, comments on the cruelty of a neighbor in 55-and-older neighborhood, post-doomer absurdism, a cover of an AI girly pop song, a cover a Y2K girly pop song, discussions on polyamory, and a reminder of that one time that Joey Chestnut publicly choked a guy out.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/spotifys-daniel-ek-leads-investment-in-defense-startup-helsing.html" target="_blank">Spotify's CEO has made repeated investiments that turn your subscription money into dead children via AI drones.</a> And their audio quality is terrible. It is still available on their service because I am a hypocrite who would like people to listen to their music. But I don't recommend it.</p>
