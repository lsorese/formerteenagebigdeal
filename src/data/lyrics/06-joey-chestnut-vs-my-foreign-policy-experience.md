I have only one dream for humanity.
At the Nathan's Hotdog Eating Contest
I will stride boldly onto that stage with a fist clenched tight
and punch Joey Chestnut, the reigning champion in his stomach.

Hotdog chunks, once nestled in his gorged tummy will erupt like shrapnel from a wound.
Spraying the audience with viscera, the ensuing chaos will be the birth of new era.
Nations will crumble under the weigh of this spectacle.
The streets will once again be filled with the laughter of children as they form youth leagues by the thousands seeking to emulate the man who dared to dream.

And at the heart of it all, 
our visionary, our savior, ME
will stand tall
My name etched into the annuls of history.

AMEN.
