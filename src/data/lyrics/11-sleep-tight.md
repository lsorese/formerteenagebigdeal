Everything's fine, we're gonna be okay
Check my phone 7 times before I'm even out of bed
Scrolling for the sign that today's the day
Either the good or bad one; I'm open

Maybe it's cope, maybe I'm insane
3 more months until this thing goes sideways
I'll keep checking twice, sleep with one eye open
Because optimism's nice, but paranoia never lies

Maybe I should meditate

Read an article that says things are looking up
but the comments say we're all fucked
