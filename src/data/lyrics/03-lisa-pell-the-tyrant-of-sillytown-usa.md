Well well well, what do we have here? 
Some little trespassers think this is their private playground.
Some awful instagram photoshoot right by my prized hydrangeas.
But my property taxes pay for that grass.
Every. Single. Blade. Of. It.
So I'm going to give them a piece of my mind.

Hey, you kids! I'm documenting all of this. 
Your parents will hear about this absolute disgrace.
Don't roll your eyes at me young lady.
Back in my day we had a thing called respect for our elders.
I've got your faces on camera, so just wait until the police hear about this. 
This neighborhood is falling apart at the seams.
You're just disgusting. An absolute disgrace.

Children are not welcome here.
Don't you dare come here you entitled monsters.
This neighborhood is falling apart and your parents will hear from my lawyer.
And don't you roll you eyes at me or the community board will hear about this.
This generation has no respect. I demand respect as your elder.
