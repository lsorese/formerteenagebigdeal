**[Intro]**
I am a girl, is it okay if I speak Spanish?
Estoy hablando espa√±ol ahora
I don't know what I said 'cause I am not Dora

**[Verse]**
I feel kinda sad, do you feel me?
So, I wrote a list of things that would heal me

**[Chorus]**
Some cocaine, that would heal me
Dick from a bi guy, that would heal me
Going on a killing spree, that would heal me
Some pink girly shoes, that would heal me

**[Verse]**
Do a heal twirl, it will heal you
And if you're ugly, I will kill you
Cut you up and peel you, just kidding
**Let me read my list again

**[Chorus]**
Some cocaine, that would heal me
Dick from a bi guy, that would heal me
Going on a killing spree, that would heal me
Some pink girly shoes, that would heal me

**[Outro]**
Maybe some chicken nuggets from McDonald's would heal me
I don't know, maybe therapy? Or becoming Christian?
