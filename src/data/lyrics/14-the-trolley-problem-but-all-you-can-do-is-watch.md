Everything's fine, we're gonna be okay
Check my phone 7 times before I'm even out of bed
Scrolling for the sign that today's the day
Either the good or bad one; I'm open

Maybe it's cope, maybe I'm insane
3 more months until this thing goes sideways
I'll keep checking twice, sleep with one eye open
Because optimism's nice, but paranoia never lies

Read an article that says things are looking up
but the comments say we're all fucked
