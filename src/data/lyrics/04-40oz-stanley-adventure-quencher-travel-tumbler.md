She said "You're such a creep."
He said "I think Chinese"
She looked astonished.
He "What? Oh sorry, I've got an Airpod in."

He said "I'll have whatever you want for dinner."
She said "I don't think you ever heard a goddamn thing I've ever ever ever ever ever ever said to you, you never pay attention even when it could be saving you to listen for a moment and to care about anything dude, but I'm over it, I've over you, and listen that's ugly ugly truth."

He said "Wait, what did I do to you?"
"You're crazy just like your mom."
"Shut up and appreciate all the nice things I do for you."

She looked at this man. This small, insignificant man.
And before she knew it, it had started.
Her rage escaped and he was lying on the floor...

with a rabid over-worked, under-appreciated, over his censor, aggrivated mother of two who was beating him to death with Stanley 40oz Adventure Quencher Water Bottle screaming at the top of her lungs.

And with every swing.
And as the body jerked.
Finally twitched and stopped.
She came to her senses.

Was this all dream? 
And on the floor.
The bastard was still bleeding.
Just like always; ruining things.

If he wanted to, he would.
But he would rather die.
And if it was good enough for momma,
then I guess you'll have to try.

Because marriage is a prison built especially for you.
But this murder is self-defense now,
and the jury will think so to.

Down the ravine.
Into the dirt.
Scrub the floor.
Bloodstains first.
